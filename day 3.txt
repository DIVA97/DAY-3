1.FOR THE GIVEN JSON OVER ALL FOR LOOPS(for, for in, for of, foreach)
FOR LOOP:
	for(i=n; i<n; i++)
	{
	console.log(i)
	}
FOR IN:
	for(let i in obj1)
	{
	console.log(i);
	}
FOR OF:
	for ( let element of students )
	{
	console.log(element)
	}
FOR EACH:
	students.forEach(myFunction);
	function students(marks)
	{
	console.log(marks);
	}

3.difference between window,screen and document in javascript

WINDOW
	The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 
The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become 
members of the window object.

DOCUMENT
	The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content,
which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object.

SCREEN
	Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. 
It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix. 

4. CODEKATA PRACTICE

// Getting input via STDIN
const readline = require("readline");

const inp = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin
});

const userInput = [];

inp.on("line", (data) => {
  userInput.push(data);
});

inp.on("close", () => {
  //start-here
  //Your code goes here â€¦ replace the below line with your code logic 
  var firstline = userInput[0];
  var secondline = userInput[1];
  var thirdline = userInput[2];
 
  console.log(firstline);
  console.log(secondline);
  console.log(thirdline);

  //end-here
});
